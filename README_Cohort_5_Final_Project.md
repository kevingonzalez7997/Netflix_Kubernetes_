Timeline

Congratulations! You have made it to the final stretch of your journey here at Kura Labs. 

This Final Project will be a culmination of all of your efforts throughout Kura and combine many of the DevOps technologies you have learned throughout the last few months.

Requirements

Your project must contain all of the components below but the specific technologies you use and how you use them is up to your team to decide. The guidelines below are meant as possible technology choices but are not meant to be an exhaustive list. Discuss with your team what you would want to include from each category and start building!

1. Communication

 - Plan your project using a communication platform like Asana, Jira, Trello, Github Projects, etc.

2. Multi-Layer Multi-Tier Application

- A flask app is recommended (Python) but you can also choose an application that utilizes NodeJS or any other programming language. The application should allow you to create a system in which the frontend and backend are separated. 

3. Containerization

- ex. Docker

4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- ex. Terraform

5. CI/CD Pipeline

- Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CodePipeline etc.

6. Scripting

- Python and Bash scripts to automate processes.

7. Monitoring & Alerting

- Prometheus & Grafana or Cloudwatch to log services and systems as well as configure alarms to trigger some actionable message to email, Slack channel, SMS, etc. to warn you before things get out of hand.

8. Scalability

- Must include a way to scale your application in your production environment

9. Fault Tolerance

- Must include some form of fault tolerance in your production environment

10. Documentation

- Project overview, choice of technology, and how to operate the system. There should be technical AND non-technical documentation as well as a slide deck prepared for presentation day. 

11. Systems Design

- Cleanly drawn network architecture diagram using draw.io, Lucidchart, or your preferred diagramming tool

Extra Credit

Although it is not required, there are several other tools you can implement in your project, and will be seen as extra credit. This includes but is not limited to the following: 

Serverless (ex. AWS Lambda)

Container Management (ex. Kubernetes)

Provisioning (ex. Ansible)

Deployment strategy 

To demonstrate that you can execute a pipeline without interrupting service. 

ETL Pipeline

Automate extracting, transforming, and loading data into another resource such as an S3 bucket or RDS. 

AI and Cybersecurity elements from the concentrations

Whether you use an ML model, Trivy, or other tools in your application. 

Budget

Each Team MUST NOT exceed a total budget of $400 for testing, staging, production, monitoring, etc. ALL Final Project activities are to be done in the teamâ€™s group AWS account. You are NOT to use your individual sandbox accounts for this Final Project at any point.

Teams and Roles

Your team is expected to meet as needed and conduct standups, mimicking what your team would be doing in an agile DevOps role. Tasks need to be broken down into discrete, actionable items using your project board of choice and work must be assigned to each team member. Refer to the list below to see your role and who you are going to be working with. Please note: These responsibilities/descriptions do not include all the tasks that need to be completed. 

Timeline

We have provided below an overview of key dates for your Final Project deliverables, which include emailing us resources, scheduling check-in meetings with us, and filling out surveys. 

Deliverables

The Final Project is divided into discrete deliverables, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course. Your group is expected to email the following members of the Kura Labs Team (Pargehe, Nicole, Kingman, and Kevin) the deliverables listed at the specific dates and times listed below. 

Progress Check-in Meetings

We will be setting up three meetings (once a week) for each team to share their progress on their final project. You will be expected to present the deliverables you submitted to the instructors so that you will receive feedback. All team members are expected to attend these check-in meetings. 

Team Dynamic Check-in Survey

Every week we ask each member of each group to fill out this survey. The purpose of the form is to survey how the group dynamics are and if intervention by Kura Labs staff is necessary. If there are any issues do not wait for this check-in form. Communicate major issues with the team so that they can be resolved promptly.
